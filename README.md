## Our Project Idea

To create a site that will make it easier for people to connect with dogs for adoption in South Korea. There are sites that do this already, but are most were outdated or not visually appealing.

## MVP

We'll use sample post data as our 'backend' and complete the entire front end. If all goes smoothly, we'll look to add a real backend, where users can create an account to add, update and remove real posts.
